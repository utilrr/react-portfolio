# My unfinished React-portfolio

## Description of Project

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Aims/Goals
1. GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
2. WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
3. WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
4. WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
5. WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
6. WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
7. WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
8. WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
9. WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
10. WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
11. WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
12. WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (MixCloud, Twitter) 


## Technologies Used

React, Material, Heroku, Node Package Manager

## Challenges Faced
Trying (and failing) to manage Material UI without having used it before. My first real attempt to use React on my own. Running out of steam to get this done by the deadline.
