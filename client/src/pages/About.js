      <h1>Meet Mark</h1>
      <p>
        I'm an aspiring web developer at the beginning of a new journey, eager
        to get better in all aspects of full stack development. Currently I
        maintain a WordPress site for a nonprofit association handling front end
        support, design and information architecture. I also run the
        association's social media through facebook, twitter and instagram.
        Another important duty I perform is helping run our annual conference in
        Winston-Salem, maintaining the conference's mobile app, registration,
        and general communication issues.
      </p>

        One of my goals in taking the UNC coding boot camp was to expand my
        knowledge of website development. Over the last six months, I have
        learned a ton about modern coding practices and how to build on the
        foundation I had. It has been a rewarding, challenging and often
        humbling experience. If I've learned anything from the UNC Coding boot
        camp it's that I have much more to learn in order to reach the level of
        proficiency I desire. In class we often talk about "Imposter Syndrome"
        and I feel it every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though the boot camp is officially over, I see this as only the first
        step in a process of lifelong learning, a process of improving my skills
        every day. Warren Buffet has said the best investment a person can make
        is in himself. Make it a goal to go to bed every night smarter than you
        were when you woke up. I agree with this and strive to make it part of
        my personal practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I look back at this portfolio project in years to come I'm sure I
        will only notice the "failures." I will cringe at the various details I
        will see through the eyes of a more experienced developer than I am now.
        I hope that day comes soon. Here's to the future!
